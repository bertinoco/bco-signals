# BCO Skills Tracker — Claude Instructions

## Data integrity rules

When adding or reviewing entries in `docs/data/jobs.json`, follow these rules without exception:

- Report only what the JD states. Do not infer intent, project trends, or editorialize.
- Clusters and signals must be grounded in stated responsibilities. If a JD does not explicitly mention a responsibility, do not assign the corresponding cluster.
- Descriptions must be neutral. Describe what the JD says, not what it implies.
- If a responsibility is ambiguous, note the ambiguity rather than resolving it.
- No projections. Do not predict where the market is heading. The data speaks for itself.
- No value judgments. Do not rank roles, call one "more comprehensive" than another, or label work as "lower-complexity."

## Quote field

Each entry may include an optional `quote` field — a direct excerpt from the JD that anchors the cluster and signal assignments. Rules:

- Must be a verbatim quote from the JD. Do not paraphrase or edit.
- Choose the line or sentence that most clearly justifies the clusters and signals assigned.
- If no single excerpt is definitive, leave the field null rather than stitching sentences together.
- The field is optional. Omit it (or set to null) if no suitable quote exists.
